The Tutor Landing Page is a multi-section layout designed for online course platforms.
It follows a clean and structured UI featuring navigation, hero sections, learning topics, chapters, summary, stats, author info, newsletter, and footer.
This project was completed as part of my HTML & CSS learning journey, where I challenged myself to build the layout from scratch while following a given UI structure—but writing the code in my own way.
